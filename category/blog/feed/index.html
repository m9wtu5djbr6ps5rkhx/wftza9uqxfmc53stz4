<p>If you’re a webmaster with more than one resource cooperating with the 1xBet partners program, then statistics are vital. Keeping track of conversions, registrations and deposits is important for understanding your audience and sources of profit. The best affiliate marketing programs will enable you to perform these functions. As you may be aware of after reading a 1xBet affiliate review, partners of the company enjoy maximum flexibility in these areas.</p>



<p>Below is a detailed description of how the 1xBet partners program works in terms of statistics, and how to get the necessary data for your sites in order to help maximise your 1xBet affiliate commission.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to add multiple resources</h2>



<p>You can use the 1xBet partners program to divide your audience by traffic sources, whether it’s sites, social networks or other platforms.</p>



<p>To do this, use your 1xBet affiliate login.</p>



<p>In the main menu select &#8220;Add Site&#8221;.</p>



<p>Then add all the resources that you have.</p>



<p>You do not have to add site domains at this time &#8211; the name of the resource can be arbitrary, for example: “Group soccer FB”.</p>



<p>After adding all the sites from which you plan to conduct traffic, the 1xBet partners program gives you the opportunity to create your own link for each resource.</p>



<p>To do this, follow these steps:</p>



<p>1. Enter the &#8220;Affiliate Links&#8221; section.</p>



<p>2. In the &#8220;Site&#8221; drop-down list, select the previously created site.</p>



<p>3. Create an affiliate link.</p>



<p>Please note: This process must be performed with each site.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to view statistics on your resources</h2>



<p>For each site, the 1xBet partners program allows you to view statistics on registrations, clicks and deposits. To do this, go to the &#8220;Full report&#8221; section. In the report construction field, select the following parameters:</p>



<p>Currency (the currency in which you have created affiliate links).</p>



<p>Site (the platform for which statistics you are interested).</p>



<p>Date or date range (the time period for which you need data).</p>



<p>This report will provide an opportunity to see detailed statistics for a specific site. It is also possible to study the data on all the sites in your account. To do this, set the &#8220;All Sites&#8221; parameter in the &#8220;Site&#8221; field. Once you have added all the sites and created links for each of the resources, you will then see detailed statistics in one pivot table.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to split statistics within one domain</h2>



<p>To understand which page, section, post or video leads to better conversions, you will need to look directly at the resources of an individual site. To do this, use the “SubID” parameter. When creating a link, in addition to selecting a site, enter a label for the link in the SubID field.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to track SubID statistics</h2>



<p>After dividing the traffic by SubID, you will be able to see the report for a specific audience in two ways:</p>



<p>1. As a player report<br>Here you can see from which page or from which section certain players came.</p>



<p>2. As a report on promotional materials<br>To do this, you can sort the general statistics by SubID.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Alternative ways to view statistics</h2>



<p>As an alternative to the affiliate program, you can use CPA trackers. In this case, you can create one affiliate link and set up data collection in accordance with your wishes for detailed statistics.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why start a channel in Telegram</h2>



<p><br>Messaging apps have revolutionised the modern world &#8211; now we can communicate with other people globally at the touch of a button. The most dynamic of these is Telegram, which allows you to not only exchange ideas with friends, but also earn money. Nowadays, a channel in Telegram is comparable in potential with a Facebook page. It’s also a trending platform with huge development potential and arguably greater user participation than on Facebook &#8211; that&#8217;s because all subscribers to the channel are guaranteed to see messages in Telegram. Therefore, while the market is still young, the chance to successfully create a top channel in a specific, well-defined, niche is very high. Furthermore, the demand for such channels is constantly increasing, as is the demand for the creators of such channels. Bookmakers and other advertisers are actively trying to recruit them into affiliate programs. SimilarWeb analysts conducted a study on the popularity of instant messengers in various countries with data used from mobile devices. According to the results, the main audience of telegrams are users from Iran and Uzbekistan. What are the reasons for popularity in specific countries? Well, these vary: Arab countries &#8211; the ban on most social networks. Russia &#8211; Interest in Pavel Durov, the Russian founder of Telegram. Italy and Spain &#8211; A system of language versions and applications. But can you take advantage of the heightened interest in Telegram and make a profit? Well, in many countries, channel creators are increasingly monetizing their posts through the use of gambling affiliate marketing, commercials and other popular methods. In English-speaking countries, however, Telegram has yet to gain full momentum and the audience numbers are still comparatively low&#8230;but growing. Given that the messenger already shows excellent numbers in terms of revenue, and that English-speaking countries are generally high-income per capita, the potential is enormous.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is a Telegram channel and how to create it</h2>



<p><br>A Telegram channel is, in fact, a microblog in which authors deliver information to the audience about a topic of interest to subscribers. There are 2 types of channels: private and public, with the only difference being the way users are added. People get to private channels by invitation from the group administrator. These channels are great for private groups / corporate channels, and in our case, for users to receive exclusive forecasts for sporting events. Accompanying materials for such forecasts can be obtained, for example, by using an affiliate partner program of a bookmaker. The best gambling affiliate programs, such as 1xBet, have access to high-level promotional materials that make it easier to understand how to bet. If the link that subscribers receive is in the public domain, and “left” subscribers start adding to the channel, you can always withdraw the link through the channel settings. As the name suggests, public channels are available for subscription to everyone. An administrator can always make a private channel public through the Create public link button.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How to create a channel</h3>



<p><br>First of all, make sure that your smartphone has the latest software version. To create a channel, follow a few simple steps. 1. Open Telegram messenger and go to the settings menu. 2. Find the “Create Channel” tab and open this option. 3. Enter all required information about the name and description of the channel. 4. Select the checkbox that best suits your requirements. 5. Once you have chosen the public or private type of channel, get a URL link. 6. To make the channel easier to identify, add the channel userpic in the settings. There are no restrictions on the topics of creating channels. Developers have not yet to monetize this feature, but it will likely happen in time. However, now you can still make good money even without this function by being part of a gambling affiliate network. You can also read the feed in a channel without subscribing to it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to collect subscribers for the channel</h2>



<p><br>First of all, you can share the link to the channel with your friends and acquaintances by posting the link on social networks or email newsletters. Slightly more difficult but more interesting and, almost certainly, more effective methods include: 1.Use an existing channel directory Read the terms of the catalog and send a request for accommodation. Here are some directories for your reference: @catalog_channels @CatalogTelegram @worldchannels @tpublics 2. Offer link exchange Look for channels of similar subjects with approximately the same volume of subscribers as you have in order to arrange a link. If you manage to agree, both channels publish links to each other and redistribute part of their audience. Why is it important to remember the same volume of subscribers? It is unlikely that any channel that has 2-3 or more times more subscribers will want to exchange links with you &#8211; this will not be an equivalent exchange for it. 3. Advertising This is more complicated: you need to find good channels with your potential target audience and agree on placement. 4. Channel collections Form ratings and collections of channels of a certain subject. This does not mean that it is worth including a list of all channels &#8211; the information should be useful to readers. Indicate that you also maintain a channel (as an option &#8211; select it), this format can pique the interest of many users.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to follow statistics in Telegram</h2>



<p><br>By default, the messenger only supports two metrics: the number of views and the number of subscribers. Viewing subscribers is available for the channel administrator, other users see only their number. Telegram does not provide for the analysis of statistics of subscribed and unsubscribed channel users. The only analysis option is working with the dynamics of subscribers using bots. A unique visit constitutes viewing. If one user enters the channel from two different devices, two views will be counted. In mobile applications, the number of views after a thousand is rounded. In the desktop version of Telegram, data is rounded after 10 thousand views.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Telegram messenger bots</h2>



<p><br>All bots in Telegram are divided into inline bots and external bots. Inline bots are bots called directly in the channel by teams. The most popular of these are the following: 1. Vote (a polling bot) It is summoned by the @vote command &#8211; after that, you need to click Create new poll and the dialog menu with the bot will open. The maximum number of responses for a survey is 10. As soon as you compile a survey and press “DONE”, you will again find yourself in the channel where you will see a proposal to publish a poll. There is also a polling close function. 2. Like (offers answers in the form of likes) It is summoned by the @like command and is created by analogy with a survey. GroupAgreeBot &#8211; a detailed representation of the poll bot, which allows you to find out who voted how. Its summoned by the @groupagreebot team, but it must be warned that the results of the survey are visible to everyone, not just the channel administrator. As for external bots, they are not called by teams in the messenger. Most often, they need to be added to the channel administrators, but they allow formatting of text, viewing of basic statistics and publishing of timer posts.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The essence of Telegram in one paragraph</h2>



<p><br>A channel on Telegram is a great tool for delivering information to your audience. The viewing of messages is guaranteed not to fall below 60-70%, with the potential to reach all 100% if you have really cool content. Therefore, creating your own channel is a great option in order to start earning money, including using such a popular method as joining a casino affiliate network or bookmakers affiliate program.</p>

<p>You probably already heard from friends or relatives that they started a website and joined an affiliate program to start making money online. It sounds like something that you’d like to try as well but you’re worried it’s a complicated process and you won’t be able to handle it? There’s absolutely nothing to worry about. At 1xBet, everything is designed to make the entire experience pleasant and get the most out of your activity. So, forget everything negative you heard about other affiliate programs because 1xBet partners is taking things to a whole different level.</p>



<p>These days, an affiliate program is one of the most effective ways to make money online. There are many criteria that you should focus on when choosing an affiliate program. The best affiliate programs offer a profitable commission, timely payments and value their reputation. In such a competitive environment, it becomes very difficult for potential partners to make a choice, so we decided to tell you more about the 1xBet affiliate program.</p>



<p><strong>The principle of the affiliate program</strong></p>



<p>Let’s start by understanding how the affiliate program works. After registration, each partner will be able to generate unique links that users of his resource will be able to follow. Thanks to this identification method, there is no doubt as to which players you brought to the brand’s website.</p>



<p>The partner then promotes the brand product on their own website. All users who came from the partner’s site and start playing on 1xBet are permanently assigned to the partner. This ensures long term earning potential on the affiliate program.</p>



<p><strong>Getting started with 1xPartners</strong></p>



<p>So, you’ve already set up a website on a topic you know a lot about and you’re getting some traffic already. This is the perfect moment to start thinking about joining an affiliate program because even if the traffic on your website isn’t that massive, it’s better to start early. Plus, joining our partner program will also give you access to plenty of helpful articles on how to increase traffic and many more helpful tools to make the most out of your activity.</p>



<p>The 1xPartners affiliate program is ready for cooperation, and the registration process is hassle-free. All you need to do is go to the affiliate program website and click the “Register” button. Unlike many other affiliate programs, at 1xPartners the registration process will not tire you with a lot of fields and will not require a huge amount of information. Here’s what you need to complete to get started:</p>



<p><strong>Username</strong> – choose the username you want to use to log into your partner account</p>



<p><strong>Password </strong>– the password to keep your account safe</p>



<p><strong>Confirm Password</strong> – enter the password once again to make sure there are no typos in it</p>



<p><strong>Site</strong> – enter the URL for your website</p>



<p><strong>Site category</strong> – you can choose the domain your website approaches if you want to. This field is not mandatory</p>



<p><strong>Preferred language</strong> – choose the language you want for the dashboard</p>



<p><strong>How did you find about us </strong>– another field that is not optional but could help us deliver better services to people just like you that want to take their first steps becoming betting affiliates.</p>



<p>Once you’re done with this part of the registration process, another form will show up asking for some more personal details. We need this information so that we can get in touch and let you know when your account is approved. Also, this is the part where you decide on the payment option to receive the funds. The fields are:</p>



<p>– Name</p>



<p>– Surname</p>



<p>– Email</p>



<p>– Skype – optional</p>



<p>– Phone Number – optional</p>



<p>– Country</p>



<p>Fill out the form and wait for the moderator to process the request. The waiting period does not exceed 48 hours. And of course, participation in the 1xBet affiliate program is completely free.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1xBet Affiliate Program Payment Options</strong></h2>

<p><strong>How to promote a product and make money from it</strong></p>



<p>For 1xBet, affiliates play an important role. The company appreciates reliable partnerships, offering in return a high level of commission, high-quality promotional materials and much more.</p>

<p>Instagram is one of the most popular and fastest-growing social networks, with users sharing their opinions through photos and videos. To gain an Instagram following, posts must be vibrant, creative, and relevant. Today, the importance of Instagram in business and everyday life cannot be overstated, because: &#8211; 1.1 billion registered users &#8211; more than 80 million new photos uploaded daily &#8211; Instagram is not only popular in the USA but also worldwide. 75% of users are from other countries. Recently the largest increase in users was from Europe and Asia &#8211; 18.5 million people in Russia alone use Instagram every month Advertising on Instagram also has its own unique traits. Most ads appear in posts or comments labelled “advertising” and contain a call to action. This doesn’t suit all types of businesses &#8211; for example, its unsuitable for companies whose activities are related to the sale of B2B goods.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The main advantages of Instagram for advertisers:</h2>



<p><br>1. Inexpensive targeted advertising which is highly effective. You can actually outline the audience that will be shown the advertisement. 2. The ability to target the most popular social network in the world &#8211; Facebook. 3. Instagram users are 2.5 times more likely to click on ads than on other publications. 4. The rapid growth in the number of subscribers shows no signs of slowing. 5. High loyalty of Instagram users to brands. According to a study by GlobalWebIndex, Instagrammers very actively subscribe to company accounts.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Targeted advertising</h2>



<p><br>Instagram targeted advertising is an ad through which you can choose your viewing audience. In settings, you can determine gender, age, education, interests, place of residence, etc. Since Instagram is owned by Facebook, Instagram utilises user data from Facebook, which tracks the behavior of all users on both social networks. It analyzes what a person is watching or following, together with their likes/dislikes, hobbies and places visited. Therefore, it accurately determines which users match the selected targeting parameters and then shows ads to these people.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Types of advertising on Instagram:</h2>



<p><br>1. Via Instagram profile. 2. Through an advertising account on Facebook. 3. Through bloggers. The first type of advertising is the most relevant and effective. But, while Instagram profiles and settings are easier to understand than Facebook, it’s important that the business profile is linked to the company’s Facebook page. Through an Instagram profile, the advertiser needs to select the post that he is going to promote. Then, determine the parameters of advertising: from the target audience to the budget and the duration of its placement. Next, Instagram checks how the advertising complies with the rules of advertising activity, after which it is published. It is important to note that at any time the advertiser can stop and remove their promotion. The second type of advertising on Instagram involves launching targeted advertising through your Facebook account. You can configure all the necessary parameters of the ad and also track statistics on advertising campaigns from within your Facebook account. The third type of advertising involves the use of bloggers. That is, the customer pays a famous person to mention the product on his/her Instagram page. This option must be carefully analyzed because there is a risk that it may not be effective.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to advertise 1xBet on Instagram</h2>



<p><br>Many people are seeking how to do affiliate marketing on Instagram, but aren’t sure where to begin. Instagram can actually be a great place for successful online affiliate marketing if the correct approach is taken. The most reliable way to promote the 1xBet brand on Instagram is to work with an affiliate program. The only obstacle is that the affiliate network partner cannot add a referral link. There are however two ways to solve the problem: &#8211; link in profile header &#8211; use of a promotional code Affiliate marketing programs are a superb way to monetize your account. With 1xBet, a partner receives many advantages: 1. 1xBet &#8211; a world-renowned company with a massive number of registered users and which is associated with sports events. You can earn on coverage, forecasts and news from different tournaments, wherever they take place. 2. As a rule, people who are interested in sports are solvent (i.e &#8211; have expendable income). They make bets not only to profit but also for pure enjoyment. 3. Some affiliate programs may limit the maximum payout, but with the 1xBet affiliate program earnings are unlimited! The success depends on the creativity of the account administrator’s approach. Remember, Instagram is one of the most progressive platforms for advertising. Take the opportunity and earn money by promoting a leading betting company!</p>
